Test driving the code discussed and presented on the
[MDN Drawing Graphics page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Drawing_graphics).

# Starting Point

Downloading initial code for the project from MDN's
[0_canvas_start](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/apis/drawing-graphics/getting-started/0_canvas_start)
directory in their
[`learning-area` repo](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main)
on github.

- [x] Downloaded this code and put a copy of the files in the `mdn/projects/1-drawing_graphics` directory
  - Note that this code is extremely minimal at this time

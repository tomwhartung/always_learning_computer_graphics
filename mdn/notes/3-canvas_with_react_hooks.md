Try to get a canvas element to work with React.

# 0. Overview:

Trying to keep it as simple as possible while following this reference:

- [HTML canvas with React hooks](https://dev.to/masakudamatsu/how-to-use-html-canvas-with-react-hooks-2j47)

- [x] 1. Start with Vite, Reactjs, MDB, TypeScript, and ESLint


- [ ] 2. Copy in code from Project 1 in `mdn/projects/1-drawing_graphics/`
- [ ] 3. Update code so that the image reflects the values of the four sliders

# 1. Start with Vite, Reactjs, MDB, TypeScript, and ESLint

## 1.1. Install

**Note:** Got some warnings this time!

```
pwd                                          # /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_computer_graphics/mdn/projects
npm init vite@latest -- --template react-ts  # Project name: 3-canvas_with_react_hooks
cd 3-canvas_with_react_hooks
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** not adding MDB.

## 1.2. Update github

```
cd /var/www/always_learning/always_learning_computer_graphics
git add mdn/projects/3-canvas_with_react_hooks
git commit -m 'Adding project directory mdn/projects/3-canvas_with_react_hooks
```

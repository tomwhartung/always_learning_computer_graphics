# README.md

`README.md` file for the `always_learning_computer_graphics` repository.

# Purpose

Test-drive one or more JavaScript graphics packages for use with React, TypeScript, and MDB.

# References

Actually, looking at the
[Mozilla Developer Network site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
we might not even need to use a graphics package!
